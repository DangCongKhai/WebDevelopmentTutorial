# Backend Web Development

When developing an app, there are two parts called front-end and back-end. Front-end is the part that the user sees and interacts with. Meanwhile, back-end includes the logic behind the scene that handles the user's request. In back-end, three components are included such as server, application, database. 

## 1. Server

Server is responsible for rendering HTML content

## 2. Application


## 3. Database
