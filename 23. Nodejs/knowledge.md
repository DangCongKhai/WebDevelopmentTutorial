# Node JS

## 1. Why do we need a framework
- Reuse components, reduce overhead.
- You don't have to write things from scratch


## 2. Node JS
- "An asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications"

Meaning:
- Javascript runtime: we can run javascript on our local computer, full-stack javascript from front-end to back-end

- Asynchronous event-driven: wait for a particular event to be triggered. It doesn't have to wait for anything to be executed.

- NodeJS allows us to build an application on local computer in javascript

### 2.1 Why NodeJS
- JS fullstack
- Scales for larger applications
- Non-blocking
- Ecosystem: Node package manager is widely supported
